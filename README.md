# UnityToolsFramework
Simple Unity Tools Framework. Contains a bunch of useful modules inside `Framework` namespace such as:

- `Animators` - useful components which can be used to implement various effects, like camera shake, oscillation, rotation
- `Events` - simple event system which can help you to loosely couple interaction between your game systems ([Unity Unite 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raQ3iHhE_Kk))
- `Variables` - variable classes based on `ScriptableObjects`, can be efficiently used with Events to pass data between game systems ([Unity Unite 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raQ3iHhE_Kk))
- `SystemInfo` - useful classes to determine and override platform info
